# v0.9.0

## Breaking changes

- Remove the `StringUtil` type and its methods.
    - `JoinLines()` was the only method on this type.
- Remove the `Lift` type and move its methods onto their respective types:
    - `Lift.OnEnumerable()` -> `Renumerable.Lift()`
    - `Lift.OnOptional()` -> `Optional.Lift()`
    - `Lift.OnEither()` -> `Either.Lift()`
    - This increases coherence and is a more extensible pattern.
- Move `Composer` and `Pipeline` into the `System` namespace.
    - The `Recore.Functional` namespace has now been deleted.
      This was the only namespace that didn't match an existing `System` namespace.
- Replace `Optional<T>`'s `IEnumerable<T>` implementation with `ToEnumerable()`.
    - All of the `IEnumerable<T>` extension methods polluted IntelliSense and made it hard to figure out what you could actually do with `Optional<T>`.
    - Iterating over `Optional<T>`'s "elements" breaks its encapsulation and null safety in the same way that putting a `Value` property on it would.


## New features

- Add support for serializing several types to and from JSON using
  `System.Text.Json`:
    - `Of<T>`
    - `Optional<T>`
    - `Either<T>`
    - `Result<T>`
- Add `AnonymousComparer<T>` and `AnonymousEqualityComparer<T>`.
