# 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

- RecoreFX now targets .NET 5.0.


## New features

- The API now has type annotations for nullable references


## Bug fixes

- Fixed the equality and comparison methods of `Token`, `MappedComparer`, and `MappedEqualityComparer` so that they no longer throw `NullReferenceException` when passed `null` as an argument.
- Fixed `Of<T>.ToString()` not to throw `NullReferenceException` when the underlying value is `null`.
