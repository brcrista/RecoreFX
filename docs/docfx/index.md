# RecoreFX

**RecoreFX** fills the most common needs for C# code after the .NET standard library.

## Installation
Install from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RecoreFX/):

```
dotnet add package RecoreFX
```

## Why Recore?
There are other packages offering more LINQ-style methods, better URI handling, or implementations of `Optional`.
These packages admittedly have richer feature sets than Recore has, and may be right for your project if you want that depth of functionality.

RecoreFX is designed to feel like a natural extension of CoreFX.
It's meant to be a one-stop shop, filling in the most common use cases without a steep learning curve.
