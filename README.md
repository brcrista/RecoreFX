**RecoreFX** is the lightweight supplement to the .NET standard library, CoreFX.

## Why Recore?
There are many other great libraries out there for .NET, and Recore duplicates some of their functionality.
Recore seeks to fill in the most commonly needed missing features from CoreFX.

Recore is meant to feel like a natural extension of CoreFX and is built on the same principles.
